# Next.js Auth System

A modern authentication system that handles user registration, login, and profile management. Built with Next.js 13 and secured with industry-standard practices.

## What's Included

- Simple user registration and login
- Secure session management
- Protected routes and API endpoints
- Clean, responsive UI with Tailwind and Shadcn
- Type safety with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma

## Quick Start

1. **Get the code and install dependencies**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubho0908/colbin.git
cd colbin
pnpm install
```

2. **Set up your environment**:
Create a `.env` file with your database and secret key:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-secret-key"
```

3. **Initialize the database and start coding**:
```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev
pnpm dev
```

## Project Overview

The project follows a clean, modular structure:

```
app/
├── api/          # Authentication endpoints (login, register, etc.)
├── components/   # UI components and pages
├── lib/         # Core logic and utilities
└── store/       # State management
```


## How Authentication Works

The system provides a secure way to handle user accounts and sessions:

### Signing Up
When a new user registers, we validate their information, ensure their email isn't already taken, and securely hash their password before saving. Everything is checked and sanitized to prevent any security issues.

### Logging In
Users can sign in with their email and password. We verify their credentials, create a secure session using JWTs, and protect it using HTTP-only cookies. This means your session stays secure, even if there's malicious JavaScript on the page.

### Security Features
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- Protected sessions using JWTs
- Safe cookie handling
- Input validation to prevent attacks
- Environment variables for sensitive data

## API Overview

Our API endpoints are simple and RESTful:

### Main Endpoints
- `POST /api/register`: Sign up new users with email and password
- `POST /api/login`: Sign in and create a secure session
- `POST /api/logout`: End the current session
- `GET /api/profile`: Get the current user's profile
- `GET /api/status`: Check if user is logged in

All endpoints return clear success messages or helpful error details when something goes wrong. We handle common cases like:
- Invalid inputs (wrong email format, short passwords)
- Already registered emails
- Wrong login credentials
- Expired sessions

## Future Improvements

Here's how we could enhance the system:

### Performance & Scale
- Add caching with Redis
- Deploy with Edge Functions
- Optimize database queries and indexes

### Security
- Add two-factor authentication
- Implement email verification
- Enhance password requirements
- Add login attempt limits

### Features
- Social login (Google)
- Role-based permissions
- Better session management
- Multiple device support

### Developer Experience
- Add comprehensive logging
- Set up error tracking
- Implement automated testing
- Create CI/CD pipeline
